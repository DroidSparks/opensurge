  <p>Open Surge is an open source game inspired on classic games like Sonic the Hedgehog<sup>tm</sup>. Join Surge, Neon and Charge on their journey to save the world from the evil Gimacian the Dark! The game is highly remixable and optimized for both fast and slow hardware, working on Windows and Linux. No installation is required.</p>
  <p>Open Surge is written from the ground up in C language using the <a href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net/">Allegro game programming library</a> for graphics, sounds, player input and timers. It's being developed since 2008.</p>
  <p>This game is still in development, being made in our free time as volunteers. We need a wide range of contributions, and that means <strong>you!</strong> You can help in many areas: art, sounds, levels, etc. Curious? Please take a look at <a href="#indlink">our wiki</a>.</p>

  <!-- how to play -->
  <h2><a id="howto" class="section">How to play</a></h2>

  <h3>How to start the game</h3>
  <p>Run the <em>opensurge</em> executable.</p>

  <h3>Menu options</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start Game:</strong> starts the 1-player game mode;</li>
    <li><strong>Extras:</strong> extra levels;</li>
    <li><strong>Options:</strong> configures the game;</li>
    <li><strong>Exit:</strong> quits the game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Moving the characters</h3>
  <p>You can play using your keyboard or a joystick. If you decide to use a joystick, make sure it has at least 2 axis and 4 buttons. Plug it before you start the game! If you want to play using your keyboard, see the table below to know how you can control the characters at any level:</p>
  <table cellspacing="0">
   <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Effect</th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Arrow keys</td>
      <td>Move</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Space bar</td>
      <td>Jump</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ENTER</td>
      <td>Pause</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left CTRL key</td>
      <td>Change the active team member</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ESC</td>
      <td>Quit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PrintScreen or '='</td>
      <td>Snapshot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F6</td>
      <td>Ignore/restore joystick input</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Cooperative play</h3>
  <p>Cooperative play is an exciting feature of the game which allows you to control two or more characters simultaneously! Each character has unique advantages and disadvantages, so some team work is needed in order to get through the levels.</p>



  <!-- level editor -->
  <h2><a id="editor" class="section">Level Editor</a></h2>

  <p>When you're playing at any level, press F12 to access the level editor. The level editor has three edit modes: brick mode, built-in item mode and custom object mode. Basically a brick is a background object or a platform; a built-in item is something like a ring, a life box or a checkpoint; and a custom object is something made by users via scripting. You may press F1 in the editor to get further help.</p>
  <p>Our <a href="#indlink">website</a> contains detailed level editor tutorials.</p>
  <div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> press Left Ctrl + F12 to save the level with your modifications. This operation is irreversible! If you want to modify a level permanently, we urge you to <em>backup</em> the level/ folder! Under Linux, if you have no write privileges on the GAME_DIRECTORY/levels/ folder, the game will save it on $HOME/.opensurge/levels instead.</div>



  <!-- troubleshooting -->
  <h2><a id="trouble" class="section">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

  <p>Our <a href="#indlink">website</a> contains an updated Troubleshooting area. If you're having any problems with the game, please check out our <a href="#indlink">FAQ</a>.</p>


  <!-- advanced features -->
  <h2><a id="advanced" class="section">Advanced features</a></h2>

  <h3>Command line options</h3>
  <p>This game provides several features via command line. Open a terminal and type:</p>
  <pre>
opensurge --help
  </pre>

  <h3>Game resources</h3>
  <p><strong>Linux users:</strong> you can store custom levels, quests, images, sounds and so on in GAME_DIRECTORY/ (default) and also in $HOME/.opensurge/ . GAME_DIRECTORY is the directory where you installed the game. In other words, if the game is located in some folder which you don't have write privileges, you can, for example, make your own levels with the level editor and save them in the $HOME/.opensurge/levels/ folder.</p>



  <!-- how to compile -->
  <h2><a id="compile" class="section">How to compile</a></h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>To compile the game you need a C language compiler and the programming libraries that this project uses. You also need <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, a cross-platform open-source build system.</p>
  <p>Let's define GAMEDIR as the directory where you unpacked the game. GAMEDIR stores, among other things, this readme.html page and a file called CMakeLists.txt</p>

  <h3>Obtaining the libraries</h3>
  <p>Once your compiler is working properly, you'll need to install the following free programming libraries:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://alleg.sourceforge.net">Allegro 4.4.2</a>, with (at least) the following addons:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.ecplusplus.com/index.php?page=projects&pid=1">JPGalleg</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://tjaden.strangesoft.net/loadpng/">loadpng</a> - requires: zlib and libpng</li>
        <li><a href="http://trent.gamblin.ca/logg/">LOGG</a> - requires: libogg and libvorbis</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://opensnc.sourceforge.net/alfont/">Modified Alfont 2.0.9</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In a regular installation of Allegro 4.4, JPGalleg and loadpng and LOGG are already included by default.</p>
  <p>We won't get into details on how to install these libraries. Please check out their respective websites to know the detailed instructions.</p>

  <h3>Compiling on GNU/Linux - gcc</h3>
  <p>Open a terminal, go to GAMEDIR and run the following commands:</p>
  <pre>
chmod +x configure
./configure
make
sudo make install
  </pre>
  <p>To launch the game, type:</p>
  <pre>
opensurge
  </pre>
  <div class="tip"><strong>Note:</strong> if you find errors about the &quot;allegro-config&quot; script, it's recommended that you compile Allegro from the source code yourself (you may need X.Org development files).</div>

  <h3>Compiling on MS Windows - MinGW</h3>
  <p>If you use <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MingW</a>, make sure both <em>lib\</em> and <em>bin\</em> folders are listed on your PATH. If MinGW is installed on C:\MinGW\, you can use the command <pre>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\lib</pre> (on the Command Prompt) to achieve that goal.</p>
  <p>On the same Command Prompt, please go to GAMEDIR and run the following commands:</p>
  <pre>
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .
mingw32-make
  </pre>
  <p>Note that little '.' at the end of the first command. If everything worked well, <em>opensurge.exe</em> should be in the GAMEDIR folder.</p>

  <h3>Compiling on MS Windows - Microsoft Visual C++</h3>
  <p>In this example I'm using Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express. A similar approach should work on different versions of MSVC. On my computer, this software is installed at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\. Make sure the <em>lib\</em> folder is listed on your PATH. If you're not sure, on a Command Prompt, run <pre>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib</pre></p>
  <p>On the same Command Prompt, please go to GAMEDIR and type:</p>
  <pre>
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" .
  </pre>
  <p>Now a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file should be located on GAMEDIR. Open it, select <em>Release</em> as the Active Configuration and compile. After that you should see <em>opensurge.exe</em> inside the GAMEDIR\Release folder. Copy it to GAMEDIR.</p>
  <p>On different versions of MSVC, you must change the "Visual Studio 9 2008" argument when you run cmake. Type <pre>cmake --help</pre> on a Command Prompt for more information.</p>
  <p><a href="#indlink">Our wiki</a> contains more detailed tutorials on this subject.</p>

  <h3>Compiling on Mac OS X</h3>
  <p>Please read the <strong>Compiling on GNU/Linux</strong> area (see above) to know how to compile the game. The instructions are the same.</p>

  <h3>Other compilers/other IDEs</h3>
  <p>If you want to compile this game using other software, please run <pre>cmake --help</pre> on a terminal for more information. Using CMake, it's possible to generate the data needed for other compilers. CMake can also generate project files for other popular IDEs like Code::Blocks, KDevelop, etc. For example, under Linux, in order to generate a Code::Blocks project (opensurge.cbp), you may run <pre>./configure -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"</pre></p>
